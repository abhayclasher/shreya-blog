I am Shreya , 17 years old , student of 12th Standard and a NEET Aspirant . My aim is to become a doctor and to be a successful person in my Life, making my Parents feel proud. 

Earlier I was not into writing much but from past one year I have been having a keen interest in writing about my all inner feelings and thoughts . It feels so soothing and relaxed by writing in a peaceful and a silent environment having infinite thoughts running through my mind .

Beside writing I love to do singing and sketching as well. All these things make me free from Worldliness and Hassle .
