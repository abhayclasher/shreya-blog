We can experience and learn a lot of things from our lives . Each and every person has their own way to live their life and learn a lot of things. I am the one among those billion people in the world who has learnt not only one but a lot of lesson from my life till now. When I was a lil child I didn't knew about anything, at that time my parents were used to taught me each and everything, what is wrong, what is right, what I have to do, how to behave, how to deal with people and other many things. But now I am mature enough to deal with any situation and understand well about my surrounding. 

Since child to till now one of the major concern I learnt from my past years is that never do a mistake to trust anyone either he is ur family, friend or relative. In this today's world no one is made for u. Everyone is selfish and mean to make their work done from others. Nowadays no one is for real, everyone has their fake identity in front of others. They assume to be good from outside but from inside they are something else. 

Why I am writing this all because I have experienced such things a many times. I am very soft hearted and lovable person with others people, if someone just say two words of sweetness from my pov he/she is the best person in my life to whom I can trust . But when I get to know about him then I understand that he is not a right person to be known, he was just using me and making me fool. So these all things happened with me a lot of time, but by Experiencing all these things, now I made my myself strong enough to never trust anyone coz no one is for u, everyone on this earth is made for themselves. 

The only person on this planet who is trustworthy are your parents no one else. They are the only one who will remain with us day, night all the time either it's the tough time Or good. They work 24×7,all day,all night and earn money and respect from others not for them but only for us so that we should become a good person and make them proud in future. But During this present time period there is a lot of young generation who trust their friends and other people more than their parents, their parents are nothing in front them. This gen treat their parents as if their is no relation between them, if they want something from them then their whole world is their parents for what purpose? Just to make their work done. I just don't know when they will open their mind and understand that their is no one in this universe who u can trust on except ur parent. If  parents are the electric wires which is connected to light bulb then their children are that light bulb which will glow in dark till the wire get extinguished. 

Remember our parents are the only one who will remain with us till the end and always show the right direction to us. 

Please dont ever dare to make someone soo close to u that later u will suffer for not having him either he is ur best friend or any relative. Now I am so sick of these fake world that I made myself strong to move further in my life without Bothering others .

 _Move further and enjoy your life with what u have ,_ 

 _Give a side to such fake people without looking behind ur back_
